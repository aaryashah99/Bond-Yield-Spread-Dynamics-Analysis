# Bond-Yield-Spread-Dynamics-Analysis
This analysis examines the relationship between bond yields (specifically LQD and GS10), corporate credit spreads, and key economic variables such as unemployment rates, breakeven inflation, and economic growth. Regression analysis and correlation techniques were employed to better understand how these factors interact and influence market behavior. Excel was utilized for data collection, cleaning, and preliminary analysis, while Tableau was used for creating dynamic visualizations of these relationships. This study focuses on time-series data, providing insights into how bond yields and corporate spreads react to different economic conditions, including changes in inflation expectations and employment trends. The findings are intended to assist in forecasting market movements and understanding investor sentiment.
