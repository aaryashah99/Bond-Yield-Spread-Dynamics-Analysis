# ðŸ“Š Bond Yield & Spread Dynamics Analysis

An interactive analysis of U.S. corporate bond yield spreads using Tableau and Excel, exploring their relationship with macroeconomic indicators like unemployment, inflation, and interest rates through regression modeling, correlation heatmaps, and recession overlays.

---

##  Overview

This project investigates how key macroeconomic variables influence U.S. corporate bond yield spreads. The objective is to identify which indicators most significantly drive credit risk as expressed through spread dynamics, particularly during economic downturns.

##  Project Structure

- `Project Sheet.xlsx` â€” Core Excel workbook including:
  - Multiple linear regression modeling
  - Correlation analysis
  - Hypothesis testing
  - Time series EDA
- `MacroData.csv` â€” Raw macroeconomic data (monthly)
- `Reshaped_Correlation_Matrix.xlsx` â€” Formatted matrix for visualization

##  Tools & Techniques

- **Excel**:
  - Multi-variable regression
  - p-value analysis
  - Reshaped correlation matrices
  - Hypothesis testing

- **Tableau**:
  - Dynamic parameter selection
  - Dual-axis line charts
  - Rolling average and anomaly detection
  - Heatmaps and recession band overlays

##  Key Components

### ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Time series comparison of spreads vs. macro indicators
- Rolling averages to highlight volatility
- Visualization of anomalies and cyclical patterns

### ðŸ”¹ Correlation Matrix
- Heatmap of spread relationships with macro variables
- Highlighting strong correlations like unemployment vs. spreads

### ðŸ”¹ Regression Modeling
- Response variable: Corporate Bond Spread
- Predictors: Unemployment, inflation expectations, policy rate, Treasury yields
- Interpretation of coefficients and statistical significance

### ðŸ”¹ Interactive Tableau Dashboard
- Select macro variables dynamically
- Overlay recession periods
- Explore multiple credit ratings and indicators visually

##  Key Insights

- **Unemployment** is the strongest and most consistent predictor of credit spreads.
- **Federal Funds Rate** moderately influences spread behavior.
- **Inflation expectations** had weak predictive power in this analysis.
- Spreads reliably spike during recessionary periods, reflecting rising credit risk.

##  Outcome

This project demonstrates how a combination of **financial analytics**, **statistical modeling**, and **interactive data visualization** can uncover critical insights into credit market behavior.
